Let's Count

While Omar was studying for Math lectures, he found the following problem. 
Given 
3
3 Integers 
N
1
N1, 
N
2
N2, 
N
3
N3, count the number of common divisors which divide all of them.

Can you please help Omar in solving this problem, because he usually sleeps in lectures.

Input:

Given an integer 
T
T, which indicates the number of test cases.
For each test case: given 
3
3 separated integers 
N
1
,
N
2
,
N
3
N1,N2,N3.

Output:

For each test case: print the number of common divisors which divide 
N
1
,
N
2
,
N
3
N1,N2,N3. Print each case in a separate line.

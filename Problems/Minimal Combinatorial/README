Minimal Combinatorial

Given two integers - n and r, your task is to calculate the combinatorial nCr. 
nCr = n! / r! (n-r)! 
The caveat is that you have to write code to do this calculation in minimum number of characters. 

UPDATE: The testcases for this problem have been fixed. Please try submitting your solution again.

Input 
The first line will be number of testcases T. Then T lines follow, each containing two positive integers - n and r. 

output 
Print T lines, each line containing the value of nCr. 

Constraints 
1 <= T <= 100 
1 <= r <= n <= 1000 

You can assume that the value nCr will fit into a signed 64 bit integer. 

Scoring 
If your program passes all the testcases, the score will be assigned according to the following formula:
num_chars = length of source code
Score = (1000 - num_chars) / 10 

You can understand that you have to reach as close to 100 as possible. Have fun :)

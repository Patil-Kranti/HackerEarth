Average sequence

Today Oz is playing with two lists 
A
A and 
B
B. List 
A
A contains 
N
N elements. List 
B
B is formed by replacing every element of List 
A
A by average value of all elements before current element including current one. For example :
If list 
A
A is like : 
a
,
b
,
c
a,b,c then 
list 
B
B will be like : 
a
1
,
a
+
b
2
,
a
+
b
+
c
3
a1,a+b2,a+b+c3
Now you are given list 
B
B and you have to find list 
A
A. So help Oz with this task.

Input :
First line contain an integer 
N
N - size of list 
B
B
Second line contains 
N
N space separated integers - elements of list 
B
B

Output :
Output 
N
N space separated integers - elements of list 
A
A
Test data is such that list 
A
A elements are always integers.

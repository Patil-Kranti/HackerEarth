Fast Sort

From the childhood we are taught that 
a
a comes before 
b
b then 
b
b comes before 
c
c and so on.So whenever we try to sort any given string we sort it in that manner only placing 
a
a before 
b
b and so on.But what happens if we initially change the pattern of sorting .This question arrived in Arav's young mind. He thought what would the final string be like if 
z
z comes before 
a
a and 
a
a comes after 
c
c and so on. He got really puzzled in finding out the final sorted string.So he asks you for help.

He gives you two strings.One the pattern string 
P
P which decides the order of alphabets and the second that is the final string 
F
F which needs to be sorted. Help him by telling him the final sorted string.

Input:

The first line contains 
T
T denoting the number of test cases.Each test case consists of two lines.The first line contains the pattern string 
P
P indicating the relative ordering of alphabets and the second line contains the final string 
F
F to be sorted.

Output:

Print 
T
T lines where each line contains the sorted string.

Constraints:

Both the string consists only of characters '

E. Simple Binary Problem

This is the simplest problem in whole contest, pretty straight forward!
You have to find if the given two numbers sums up to form an even number. Just to add twist , numbers will be in their binary form.

INPUT FORMAT :
First line of input will contain an integer N, denoting number pair of inputs.
Following N lines will contain two binary strings , A and B.

OUTPUT FORMAT :
Your output should contain N lines, each line containing "Yes" if numbers sums up to even otherwise "No" (without "").

CONSTRAINTS :
1= N = 102
11= length of A and B = 104

SAMPLE INPUT 
2
101 100
100 000
SAMPLE OUTPUT 
No
Yes
Explanation
testcase 1 : 101 = 1x22 + 1x22 + 1x20 = 5

similarly, 100 = 1x22 + 1x22 + 1x22 = 4

5+4=9 which is odd. Hence No

Same applies for sample testcase 2.

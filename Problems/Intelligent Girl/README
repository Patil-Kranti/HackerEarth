Intelligent Girl

Soumika has a string 
S
S and its starting index is 
1
1. The string 
S
S consists of characters from 
1
−
9
1−9. As she is very intelligent, she wants to test his brother Vinay Tendulkar. She asked her brother Vinay Tendulkar to count the number of even numbered characters ( i.e 
2
,
4
,
6
,
8
2,4,6,8 ) for every index 
i
i 
(
1
≤
i
≤
|
S
|
)
(1≤i≤|S|). For an index 
i
i, the result should be calculated from 
i
i to the end of the string. As Vinay doesn't know about programming, he wants you to help him find the solution.

Input:

Explanation
Given string 
S
S is 
574674546476
574674546476.
for index 
1
1
Number of even numbers from 
5
5 to end of the string is 
7
7 so the result of index 
1
1 is 
7
7.
for index 
2
2
Number of even numbers from 
7
7 to end of the string is 
7
7 so the result of index 
2
2 is 
7
7.
for index 
3
3
Number of even numbers from 
4
4 to end of the string is 
7
7 so the result of index 
3
3 is 
7
7.
for index 
3
3
Number of even numbers from 6 to end of the string is 
6
6 so the result of index 
4
4 is 
6
6.....
